# MoodEye - Interactive Ambient Display

## Project Overview
MoodEye is an interactive desk ornament that displays evolving animations through a round display enhanced by a convex lens. It responds to environmental conditions and user interaction to create an engaging visual experience.

## Hardware Components
- ESP32 development board (recommended: ESP32-WROOM-32)
- Round LCD display (recommended: GC9A01 240x240 pixel round LCD)
- Convex lens (50-70mm diameter, focal length ~100mm)
- PIR motion sensor or capacitive touch sensor
- Optional: ambient light sensor (BH1750)
- 3D printed or laser-cut case
- USB-C or micro-USB power supply
- Prototyping materials (wires, headers, etc.)

## Core Features
1. Animation Modes
   - Geometric patterns (circles, spirals, mandalas)
   - Particle systems
   - Wave/fluid simulations
   - Color transitions

2. Interaction Features
   - Motion-activated pattern changes
   - Ambient light response
   - Time-based transitions
   - Touch/proximity response

3. System States
   - Idle (subtle, slow animations)
   - Active (responsive, dynamic patterns)
   - Transition (smooth morphing between patterns)
   - Sleep (low power, minimal display)

## Alternative Applications
1. Ambient Notification Display
   - Email/message indicators
   - Calendar reminders
   - Weather updates
   - System status monitor

2. Interactive Mood Lamp
   - Music visualization
   - Room ambient lighting
   - Biorhythm indicator
   - Meditation aid

3. Environmental Display
   - Weather patterns
   - Air quality indicator
   - Temperature visualization
   - Humidity display

4. Time-Based Visualizer
   - Artistic clock display
   - Day/night cycle visualization
   - Pomodoro timer
   - Meeting countdown
